#A) To avoid matching error in NGS and PCR data, I will do the following:

1)	Check the content and size of the data files.  
2)	To make sure that there is a common identifier (matching sample names) in NGS and PCR data.
3)	If both files (NGS and PCR) contains data generated from a single sample then I will use gene names/transcript names to match the files

#B) Feedbacks

1)	Make sure that the data is clean and complete
2)	Without a common identifier, the data matching between NGS and PCR files would be unsuccessful.
