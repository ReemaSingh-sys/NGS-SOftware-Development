# a)	Do you need to re-validate your software? 
As far as the PCR machine (in another room) generates data in the same format (as generated by validated PCR machine), there is no need to re-validate the software.
# b) If so, what would be the best approach? 	
For some reason, if the software unable to read the data generated from the PCR machine (in another room) then I will first convert the newly generated data format in the same format required by the software to run. I will also test the software with a small sample set before running it on the larger one.
# c) You need to transfer your software to the new desktop machine, or not? 	
No, I donâ€™t need to transfer my software to another machine. The newly generated data can be transferred to the computer that has software installed in it.
