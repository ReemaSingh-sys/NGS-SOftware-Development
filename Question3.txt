# Tool to generate variant files from bam files.

I will use Samtools for varint calling. There are two steps involved in this process - 1) sort and index bam files, 2) Call variant and write a vcf file.
I wrote a small perl script to perform this function. Please find the script Varinatcalling.pl under scripts directory.

Usage of the Varinatcalling.pl
