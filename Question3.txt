# A) Tool to generate variant files from bam files.

I will use Samtools for varint calling. There are two steps involved in this process - 1) sort and index bam files, 2) Call variant and write a vcf file.
I wrote a small perl script to perform this function. Please find the script Varinatcalling.pl under scripts directory.

Usage of the Varinatcalling.pl

# perl scripts/Variantcalling.pl bamfiles.txt FA1090.fasta


B) There are many ways to check the validity of the variants. For instalce:

- By generating some performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificty, precision, and false positive rates.
- Using wet-lab validation approaches such as PCR (or real-time quantitative PCR), sanger sequencing.
